            Through continued development, the purpose of this website is to become a successor to the late, great,
            www.hirsutum.info. We owe a debt of gratitude to Herman & Marjo Van Ree and to the Hirsutum contributors for
            over
            a decade of work, including data collection and assembly.
        </p>

            Special thanks to Sean Rafferty for his generosity, time, and wealth of advice. Sean first described to me
            www.hirsutum.info, its utility to the community, and it's unfortunate demise. That conversation became the
            origin of this project.
